# Runbook

Owner: Aakash · Version: 1.0 · Date: 19 October 2026

## Summary

Checklists for working on AlgoDesk Next from the terminal. Always start a terminal with `source scripts/env.sh` so everything stays inside the project folder. Before committing, run `bash scripts/check.sh` and expect `CHECK: PASS`. Run `algodesk doctor` to see the health of the environment (exit 0 all good, 1 warnings, 2 critical). Change adjustable numbers only with `algodesk param set` and a reason. If a check fails, use the table at the end. Live-trading routines are added when the remote runner exists (milestone M7).

## Every terminal session

1. `cd` into the project folder.
2. `source scripts/env.sh` (prints `ENV: isolated at <folder>`).
3. Prefix every `uv` command with `source scripts/env.sh &&` if unsure.

## Before every commit

1. `bash scripts/check.sh` ends with `CHECK: PASS`.
2. `git status --short` shows only files you expect (never `data/`, `logs/`, `.local/`, `_workbench/`).
3. Commit and push; AI agents never run `git add`, `commit` or `push`.

## Health check

`algodesk doctor` (add `--verbose` for passes, `--only <id>` for one check, `--json` for machines). Fix every critical item before starting any real run.

## Change a parameter

1. `algodesk param show <prefix>` to see the current value.
2. `algodesk param set <name> <value> --reason "<why>"`. Tightening applies at once.
3. Loosening while a live strategy is armed needs `--confirm "LOOSEN <name>"` and takes effect at the next session start.
4. `algodesk param history <name>` shows the audit trail; `algodesk param reset <name> --reason "<why>"` returns to the default.

## Check the journal

`algodesk journal verify` (hash chain), `algodesk journal tail -n 20`, `algodesk journal runs` (runs that did not close cleanly appear as crashed).

## Upstox authentication & login ceremony

### 1. Analytics token (recommended for backtest/research)
- Generate a 1-year Analytics Token in the Upstox Developer Console.
- Store token securely: `algodesk secrets set upstox_analytics_token`.
- Verify presence: `algodesk login status`.
- Note: Analytics tokens never expire daily, but cannot place live orders.

### 2. OAuth interactive login ceremony
- Ensure credentials exist: `algodesk secrets set upstox_client_id` and `algodesk secrets set upstox_client_secret`.
- Run automated login: `algodesk login upstox`.
- Authorize in browser; redirect hits `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and stores `upstox_access_token`.
- Manual fallback: `algodesk login upstox --manual` prints the URL and prompts for code.

### 3. Port 5000 note (macOS AirPlay Receiver)
- On macOS Monterey and later, system AirPlay Receiver listens on port 5000 by default.
- If port 5000 is occupied, `algodesk doctor --run demo_paper` warns `upstox.redirect_port in use`.
- To free port 5000: System Settings -> General -> AirDrop & AirPlay -> Turn off "AirPlay Receiver".
- Alternatively, run `algodesk login upstox --manual` which requires no local port.

## Market data management

### 1. Synthetic data generation
Generate deterministic synthetic ticks and quotes for offline testing:
`algodesk data synth --symbols NSE:EQ:HDFCBANK,NSE:EQ:SBIN --days 3 --rows 2000 --seed 1`

### 2. Inspecting coverage
List data files grouped by dimensions:
- By exchange: `algodesk data list --group-by exchange`
- By segment: `algodesk data list --group-by segment`
- Filter by group: `algodesk data list --group demo5`
- As JSON: `algodesk data list --json`

### 3. Deleting market data
Deletion stages files into `data/.trash/<timestamp>/` and records a journal event.
- Dry run: `algodesk data delete HDFCBANK --from 2026-10-01 --dry-run --reason "cleanup"`
- Typed confirmation: `algodesk data delete HDFCBANK --reason "cleanup"` (prompts `DELETE <n> files`)
- Force confirmation: `algodesk data delete HDFCBANK --reason "cleanup" --yes`
- Group delete: `algodesk data delete "@demo5" --dry-run --reason "cleanup"`
- Permanent purge: `algodesk data delete HDFCBANK --purge --reason "immediate"`
Note: Deletions are refused while another process holds an active journal writer lock.

### 4. Safety trash management
- List staged trash: `algodesk data trash list`
- Purge trash: `algodesk data trash purge --yes`

### 5. Compaction
Merge instrument-day part files into single daily parquet files:
- All uncompacted: `algodesk data compact`
- Specific date: `algodesk data compact --date 2026-10-23`

### 6. Instrument groups
- List groups: `algodesk groups list`
- Inspect a group: `algodesk groups show demo5`

## If something fails

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ISOLATION` or `env.isolated` fails | New terminal without `env.sh` | `source scripts/env.sh`; rebuild `.venv` with `uv sync` if the interpreter path is wrong |
| `DOCTOR` critical on `config.valid` | Bad key or value in a TOML file | Read the three error lines (file, key, fix) |
| `lint` error `hard_coded_limit` | Number assigned to a limit-like name | Move it to `config/params/*.toml` |
| `docs check` error | Missing Summary or stale `docs/INDEX.md` | Add the Summary; run `algodesk docs index` |
| `secrets scan` finding | Secret-like text in a file | Replace with `secret:<name>`; never commit secrets |
| `budget` FAIL | Too many dependencies | Remove one or approve the change |
| Agent ran out of tokens | Work stopped mid-card | Read the last lines of `_workbench/handoff.md` and resume in a new conversation |
